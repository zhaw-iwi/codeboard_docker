# Docker file to create a container for running C and C++.
# Will use GCC which comes with Ubuntu 14.04.

# To build this file execute (including "." at the end): docker build --file="cobo_ubuntu.docker" --tag="cobo/ubuntu" --rm=true .
#
# Note: we're only using a single RUN command to minimize the number of layers
# that Docker will create (every RUN commands creates a new layer). Commands are
# conncatenated with && and a new line is indicated with \

# The script adds a group "cobo" and a user "cobo" that have the group-id
# and user-id 2506. It also installs the "bc" tool and copys a bash script
# into the home folder of the "cobo" userc
